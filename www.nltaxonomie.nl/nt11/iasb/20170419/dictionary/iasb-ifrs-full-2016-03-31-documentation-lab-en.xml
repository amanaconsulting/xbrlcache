Gross investment in the finance lease is the sum of: (a) the lease payments receivable by a lessor under a finance lease; and (b) any unguaranteed residual value accruing to the lessor. Interest rate implicit in the lease is the rate of interest that causes the present value of (a) the lease payments and (b) the unguaranteed residual value to equal to the sum of (i) the fair value of the underlying asset and (ii) the initial direct costs of the lessor.</link:label>
